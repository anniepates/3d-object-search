2171250,Get you anti zombification meds neatly organized with this pill dispenser. It has 7 chambers and one blank to close it. Made this for my girlfriend when she had to take meds on a daily basis and hated the big boxes form the hospital. She is a big fan of the Resident Evil games so I surprised her with this. Print the bottom in white. The top in black and 4 of the covers in red and 3 in white. Glue the covers onto the top piece as shown in the pictures and use a screw to attach it to the bottom (one from a servo works nicely cause of the smooth shaft at the end of the screw) Don't tighten it to much or you won't be able to rotate it properly.

8626,"I wanted a small box to hold a few pills that would keep them clean and safe from crushing.  But this box could be used for anything small with some adjustments to the cavity shape.  The lid uses a dovetail joint for tightness and fit tolerance. This model is fully parametric, but some of the parameters need some work so that the adjusted box always works.  Some of the walls may be thicker than necessary.   The first design holds 4 pills in two stacks.  The second design holds 5 pills on their edge instead. The second version of the lid has a square indention (which bridges nicely) to make opening the box easier. The outside dimensions of the two boxes are identical."

24566,"Although there are numerous boxes for holding pills, users of pill box have often difficulties to take their medicines because they are constricted in small compartments. As students at the engineering school ENSGSI in France, we decided to create the PushthePill Box! Its design helps to select the good moment of the day. Moreover one hand is enough to hold the control vertically and to press the Â« button Â» thus pills fall down a hole. A trap door permits to fill the pillbox.

En tant qu'Ã©tudiants Ã  l'Ã©cole d'ingÃ©nieurs ENSGSI en France, nous avons crÃ©Ã© the PushthePillBox! Son design facilite la bonne prise des pilules au bon moment de la journÃ©e.

2512531,"The range of 'Capsules' are fun and practical storage containers that look like a medicine capsule so can be configured in any combination of colors and will loo great! Capsules come in a range of sizes for all sorts of different uses... including medications, cables, parts, small toys, nuts and bolts, jewellery... and lots more. There is an endless array of things that could be stored in a Capsule... so reusable as well and will make a great unique and fun gift as well. Plus... very handy to use when travelling to keep small items together and safe. Sizes (approx.) are as follows: 50mm Inside Diameter - 140mm (Long ) / 100mm (Medium) / 65mm (Short) 32mm Inside Diameter - 140mm (Long ) / 100mm (Medium) / 65mm (Short) FOB 10mm Inside Diameter - 70mm (Long) / 28mm (Short) The joint between the 'a' and 'b' parts of the capsules is a press/snap fit. Well sliced files Capsule files printed on accurate / precise machines should result in a firm joint that won't come apart until you want it to.  The 'a' (male) side of the joint has a number of tabs that are inserted into the 'b' (female) side. These tabs allow clearance for compression to create a snap / secure fit. Once joined / seated correctly the two halves will rotate against each other but not come apart until pulled apart with a slight twist / snapping action.  joint by snapping it away from the other part. Please note that the shorter versions are slightly harder to pull apart because there is less area to grip / hold onto them with... but with practice they are easy to close / open.  To make opening and closing easier it is recommended to apply a light lubricant to the mating surfaces so they slide past each other easier. Dry layered PLA can be surprisingly grippy... a single application of silicone lubricant is all it will need for the life of the capsule.   Capsules are easy prints but good build plate adhesion is critical due to the this contact area of each part on the build plate. For this reason a Raft is recommended to help hold the print secure by increasing the surface area on the build plate. A good, well formed Raft should snap away quickly / easily by hand.  Refer the print instructions and images for additional information... and please post images of your Capsules in use for other members to see. Have fun experimenting with color options!
