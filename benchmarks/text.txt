Test Plan
Unit Tests

Functionality Tests:
Test each function with valid and invalid inputs.
Ensure correct outputs for known inputs.

Edge Cases:
Empty inputs.
Extremely large inputs.
Inputs with special characters, punctuations, etc.

Integration Tests:
Ensure that functions work together correctly.
Test the entire flow from reading CSV to building the graph.

Performance Tests
Measure time taken for each function with varying input sizes.
Profile memory usage and CPU usage.

Robustness Tests
Test with malformed CSV files.
Test with missing values in CSV.
Test with non-string inputs where applicable.

Code Coverage
Ensure that all lines of code are tested.
Highlight untested paths.
Test Cases

1. create_dictionary(file_name)
Test valid CSV file:
Input: CSV with columns 'id' and 'content'.
Expected Output: Dictionary with 'id' as keys and 'content' as values.

Test CSV with missing values:
Input: CSV with some missing 'content' values.
Expected Output: Dictionary with missing values handled appropriately (e.g., empty string).

Test invalid CSV file:
Input: Malformed CSV.
Expected Output: Handle error gracefully, possibly raise an exception.

2. keyword_helper(content)
Test normal string input:
Input: "This is a test string for keyword extraction."
Expected Output: List of keywords excluding stop words and punctuation.

Test empty string:
Input: ""
Expected Output: Empty list.

Test string with only stop words and punctuation:
Input: "and, or, but, the, ..."
Expected Output: Empty list.

3. keyword_summaries(summaries)
Test dictionary with valid summaries:
Input: {"1": "This is a summary.", "2": "Another summary here."}
Expected Output: {"1": ["summary"], "2": ["another", "summary"]}

Test empty dictionary:
Input: {}
Expected Output: {}

4. match_keywords(query_list, entry_list)
Test lists with common and uncommon keywords:
Input: (["keyword1", "keyword2"], ["keyword2", "keyword3"])
Expected Output: ["keyword2"]

Test empty lists:
Input: ([], [])
Expected Output: []

5. create_kw_edges(summary_kws)
Test with valid summary keywords:
Input: {"1": ["keyword1", "keyword2"], "2": ["keyword2", "keyword3"]}
Expected Output: List of tuples representing edges with weights.

Test with empty summary keywords:
Input: {}
Expected Output: Empty list.

6. build_kw_graph(kws)
Test with valid keywords:
Input: {"1": ["keyword1", "keyword2"], "2": ["keyword2", "keyword3"]}
Expected Output: NetworkX graph object.

Test with empty keywords:
Input: {}
Expected Output: NetworkX graph object with no nodes or edges.

7. load_seg_similaritites(file_name)
Test valid CSV file:
Input: CSV with segment similarity data.
Expected Output: DataFrame with segment similarities.

Test invalid CSV file:
Input: Malformed CSV.
Expected Output: Handle error gracefully, possibly raise an exception.

8. create_seg_edges(seg_ids, file_name)
Test with valid segment IDs and similarity file:
Input: {"1": ["seg1", "seg2"], "2": ["seg2", "seg3"]}, valid CSV file.
Expected Output: List of tuples representing edges with weights.

Test with empty segment IDs:
Input: {}, valid CSV file.
Expected Output: Empty list.

9. build_seg_graph(kws, file_name)
Test with valid segment IDs and similarity file:
Input: {"1": ["seg1", "seg2"], "2": ["seg2", "seg3"]}, valid CSV file.
Expected Output: NetworkX graph object.

Test with empty segment IDs:
Input: {}, valid CSV file.
Expected Output: NetworkX graph object with no nodes or edges.

10. update_probabilities(seg_ids, seg_similarity_file, desc_kws)
Test with valid segment IDs, similarity file, and description keywords:
Input: {"1": ["seg1", "seg2"], "2": ["seg2", "seg3"]}, valid CSV file, {"1": ["keyword1", "keyword2"], "2": ["keyword2", "keyword3"]}.
Expected Output: Updated probabilities dictionary.

Test with empty inputs:
Input: {}, valid CSV file, {}.
Expected Output: Handle gracefully, possibly empty probabilities dictionary.
